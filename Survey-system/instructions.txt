 To use the system you need an offline wampserver 
 Can download it and use the normal settings when installing it. 
 after installation one should copy or move the folder Survey-sytem into the wampserver " www" folder
 The folder is usually located in the " windows/wampsever64/www" folder 
After moving the folder you should import the survey_db.sql file in mysql, 
to do that you first need to run wampserver once all serves are running on or has a green icon.
left click go to phpmyadmin enter the this username "root" press enter.
 once inside phpmyadmin you should go to import sql and go to the survey_db.sql file it will automatically create the database including the relavent table.
the survey_db.sql file is located in folder named " sql_query"
after you successfully imported ypu should be able to fill form and view results.
The web application is built using mysql as a database, sql query language, bootstrap and php.
if the creation of the database should fail copy and paste the following code into 
the sql tab - 

create database survey_db
use survey_db; 

create table surveydata (
    ID INT(6) primary key NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
    Surname  varchar(255) not null, 
    Names varchar(255) not null, 
    contactNo varchar(255) not null , 
    currentDate date not null, 
    favouriteFoods varchar(1000) not null, 
    eatingOut int(10) not null, 
    watchingMovies int(10) not null, 
    watchTv int(10) not null,
    radioListener int(10) not null
 );
